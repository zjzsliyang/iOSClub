### About
`SPPermissions` is an API to ask for user permissions using Swift. The API provides for three UI options (list, dialog & native). The UI/UX is in an **Apple style** and supports iPad, dark mode, & tvOS. Also you can check the state permissions using the API.

## 5.x Migration

I have migrated `SPPermissions` to the new `5.0` vesion. If you find any bugs or need any of the old functionality - please create an issue or write me. If you want stay on the old version (4.x), add this to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions', '4.1.4'
```

I recomended that you install the new version and create an issue if you have a problem. I generally response to and resolve all issues in 24-48 hours.

## Requirements

Swift `4.2` & `5.0`. Ready for use on iOS 11+

## Installation

### CocoaPods:

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `SPPermissions` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Notification'
```

Due to Apple's new policy regarding permission access you need to specifically define what kind of permissions you want to access using subspecs. For example if you want to access `Camera`, `Location` & `Microphone` you define the following:

```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Camera'
pod 'SPPermissions/Location'
pod 'SPPermissions/Microphone'
```

<details><summary>Available subspecs</summary>
<p>

```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Camera'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Contacts'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Calendar'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/PhotoLibrary'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Notification'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Microphone'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Reminders'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/SpeechRecognizer'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Location'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Motion'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/MediaLibrary'
```
```ruby
pod 'SPPermissions/Bluetooth'
```

</p>
</details>

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate `SPPermissions` into your Xcode project using Xcode 11, specify it in `File > Swift Packages > Add`:

```ogdl
https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPermissions
```

After integrate need add configuration. See example [SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPermissions/blob/master/Source/Supporting%20Files/SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig) file or example project. If you don't know how add configuration file, see this [short video](https://youtu.be/1kR5HGVhJfk).

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate `SPPermissions` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "ivanvorobei/SPPermissions"
```

By default available all permissions. You can provide custom build flags _before_ building the dynamic framework to only compile
with permissions you request. Open file [SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPermissions/blob/master/Source/Supporting%20Files/SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig) in `Source/SPPermissions/Supporting Files`, comment unusable permissions and rebuild:

```ruby
carthage build
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate `SPPermissions` into your project manually. Put `Source/SPPermissions` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.

After it need add configuration. See example [SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPermissions/blob/master/Source/SPPermissions/Supporting%20Files/SPPermissionsConfiguration.xcconfig) file or example project. If you don't know how add configuration file, see this [short video](https://youtu.be/1kR5HGVhJfk).

## Usage

This project had separate modules for the display UI options. The interfaces are: `Dialog`, `List` and `Native`. Each interface has delegates and a datasource. If you want see an example app, open `SPPermissions.xcodeproj` and choose the `Example` target. 

### Dialog

This is a Modal alert, which was used in the previous version (<5.x). I recomend the use of this alert style when your requested permissions are less than three. Usage example:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.dialog([.camera, .photoLibrary])

// Ovveride texts in controller
controller.titleText = "Title Text"
controller.headerText = "Header Text"
controller.footerText = "Footer Text"

// Set `DataSource` or `Delegate` if need. 
// By default using project texts and icons.
controller.dataSource = self
controller.delegate = self

// Always use this method for present
controller.present(on: self)
```

### List

Native `UITableViewController` with support for the iPad. Use it with more than two permissions. An example of how it is used:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.list([.calendar, .camera, .contacts])

// Ovveride texts in controller
controller.titleText = "Title Text"
controller.headerText = "Header Text"
controller.footerText = "Footer Text"

// Set `DataSource` or `Delegate` if need. 
// By default using project texts and icons.
controller.dataSource = self
controller.delegate = self

// Always use this method for present
controller.present(on: self)
```

### Native

Request permissions with native alerts. You can request many permissions at once:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.native([.calendar, .camera, .contacts])

// Set `Delegate` if need. 
controller.delegate = self

// Always use this method for request. 
// You can pass any controller, this request becouse need implement base protocol.
controller.present(on: self)
```

</p>

To check the state of any permission, call enum `SPPermission`: 

```swift
let state = SPPermission.calendar.isAuthorized
```

Also available is the func `isDenied`. This returns false if the permission has not been requested before.

## DataSource & Delegate

For a customized permssions view, implement `SPPermissionsDataSource`:

```swift
func configure(_ cell: SPPermissionTableViewCell, for permission: SPPermission) -> SPPermissionTableViewCell {
    return cell
}
```

Using a delegate, you can customize texts, colors, and icons. For a default view configure with the default values. After configuration return the cell.

You can customize:

```swift
// Titles
cell.permissionTitleLabel.text = "Notifications"
cell.permissionDescriptionLabel.text = "Remind about payment to your bank"
cell.button.allowTitle = "Allow"
cell.button.allowedTitle = "Allowed"

// Colors
cell.iconView.color = .systemBlue
cell.button.allowedBackgroundColor = .systemBlue
cell.button.allowTitleColor = .systemBlue

// If you want set custom image.
cell.set(UIImage(named: "IMAGE-NAME")!)
```

### Delegate

In the delegate you can implement these methods: 

```swift
// Events
func didAllow(permission: SPPermission) {}
func didDenied(permission: SPPermission) {}
func didHide(permissions ids: [Int])

// Denied alert. Show alert if permission denied.
func deniedData(for permission: SPPermission) -> SPPermissionDeniedAlertData?
```

You can detect permission values as follows:

```swift
let permissions = ids.map { SPPermission(rawValue: $0) }
```

### Denied alert

If you don't want show an alert if a permission is denied, return `nil` in the delegate. You can set the text in the alert: 

```swift
func deniedData(for permission: SPPermission) -> SPPermissionDeniedAlertData? {
    if permission == .notification {
        let data = SPPermissionDeniedAlertData()
        data.alertOpenSettingsDeniedPermissionTitle = "Permission denied"
        data.alertOpenSettingsDeniedPermissionDescription = "Please, go to Settings and allow permission."
        data.alertOpenSettingsDeniedPermissionButtonTitle = "Settings"
        data.alertOpenSettingsDeniedPermissionCancelTitle = "Cancel"
        return data
    } else {
        // If returned nil, alert will not show.
        return nil
    }
}
```

If you don't implement this method, the alert will appear with default text. To disable the alert you just need return `nil`.

## Good Practices

I recommend that you show the user all of the permission options, even if some of them are already allowed. But if you want to request only non-allowed permissions, use this code:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.list([.notification, .reminders].filter { !$0.isAuthorized } )
controller.present(on: self)
```

A good way to check for the need to show a dialog: check that all permissions are currently authorized by the user:

```swift
let permissions = [.notification, .reminders].filter { !$0.isAuthorized }
if permissions.isEmpty {
    // No need show dialog
} else {
    // Show dialog
}
```

If you request location services, you can show both `.locationWhenInUse` & `.locationAlwaysAndWhenInUse`. If the user allowed `always` mode, they can also change to `when in use` mode:

```swift
let controller = SPPermissions.dialog([.locationWhenInUse, .locationAlwaysAndWhenInUse])
controller.present(on: self)
```

## Keys in Info.plist

You need to add some keys to the `Info.plist` file with descriptions. List of keys:

- NSCameraUsageDescription
- NSContactsUsageDescription
- NSCalendarsUsageDescription
- NSMicrophoneUsageDescription
- NSAppleMusicUsageDescription
- NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription
- NSMotionUsageDescription
- NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription
- NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription
- NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription (iOS 10 and earlier)
- NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription
- NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription (iOS 12 and earlier)

Do not use the description as the name of the key.

### Localization keys

If you use xliff localization export, keys will be create automatically. If you prefer do the localization file manually, you need to create `InfoPlist.strings`, select languages in the right side menu and add keys as keys in plist-file. See:

```
"NSCameraUsageDescription" = "Here description of usage camera";
```

## Сooperation

The use of this project is completely free. If you can make a contribution, it will help with development. Here is a list of tasks and what needs to be done:

- Add docs in source files. Add a description of public methods and parameters. 
- Subtitles for this [video](https://youtu.be/1kR5HGVhJfk) in any of your native languages, where I tell you how to connect a configuration file.
- Fix SPM support. Now SPM ignore config flags. Issue [#156](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPPermissions/issues/156)
- Help me translate my app [Debts - Spending tracker](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1446635818) for other languages. 
- Add an icon for tv os example target.
- Add code for `Bluetooth` request permission. For now after request `Bluetooth` developers get error.

## Design of previous version

I developed `SPPermissions` in an 'Apple-way'. To accomplish this, I checked 30 apps to get UI-elements for this project. I then took screenshots and re-drew the elements in Sketch. For example, the project's `Allow` button is similar to the `Get` button in the AppStore. Check this [timelapse](https://youtu.be/1mDdX7fQRv4) to see how I designed the `4.0` version of  `SPPermissions`:
